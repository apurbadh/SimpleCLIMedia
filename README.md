# Simple CLI Social Media From C++

I created this as practice for C++ and Object Oriented Programming.

## How to run it?
First of all you need some kind of C++ compiler to run it. For demonstraction I will be using g++ but any others should work

## Steps

#### Compile All the files including headers
```
g++ main.cpp src/* -I ./includes/ -o main
```
#### Run the compiled binary
```
./main
```
